## Instructions for Contibutors:
 While it is extra work, i think it makes the documents alot easier to read 😁 If you have any ideas for this repo, just go for it! 
 If you would like to help build out this repository as we go along with the course, here is a basic outline of what I am doing currently.

* Each of the 12 microsoft learn segments should have their own markdown file that follows the current naming structure. ex 'Section[scrtion number]-[two word summary].md
* As you walk through the each page of a microsoft learn segment, copy the text into a notepad or into the repository. I like to use this browser markdown editor aswell 👉 [StackEdit.io](https://stackedit.io/)
* Images should be uploaded into the repository and linked in the markdown page with ```![img](<link to image uploaded image in repo>)```
* If you need to copy a table into the repo, use [this tool](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to copy table text and convert it to markdown format
* All internal microsoft links provided in the segment should be formated to work in markdown. If the links are to a specific documentation or valuable resource like 'Speech-to-text API Documentation' - feel free to put that in the above **Useful Links** section in this readme for easy access in the future.

### Text Formatting
As I bring text into the repo, I do my best to maintain the formatting if possible, this includes
* creating bullet points where needed. ex:  ```* foo```
* maintain *italicized* and **bold** font styles. ex: ```*italicized*``` and ```**bold**```
* Use title 1 for segment headings. ex: ```# Segment Title```
* Use title 2 for segment section. ex: ```## Step 1```
* Use title 3 for sub-sections. ex: ```### Step 1: part 1```
