## Instructions for Contibutors:
 While it is extra work, i think it makes the documents alot easier to read üòÅ If you have any ideas for this repo, just go for it! 
 If you would like to help build out this repository as we go along with the course, here is a basic outline of what I am doing currently.

* Each of the 12 microsoft learn segments should have their own markdown file that follows the current naming structure. ex 'Section[scrtion number]-[two word summary].md
* As you walk through the each page of a microsoft learn segment, copy the text into a notepad or into the repository. I like to use this browser markdown editor aswell üëâ [StackEdit.io](https://stackedit.io/)
* Images should be uploaded into the repository and linked in the markdown page with ```![img](<link to image uploaded image in repo>)```
* If you need to copy a table into the repo, use [this tool](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to copy table text and convert it to markdown format
* All internal microsoft links provided in the segment should be formated to work in markdown. If the links are to a specific documentation or valuable resource like 'Speech-to-text API Documentation' - feel free to put that in the above **Useful Links** section in this readme for easy access in the future.

### Text Formatting
As I bring text into the repo, I do my best to maintain the formatting if possible, this includes
* creating bullet points where needed. ex:  ```* foo```
* maintain *italicized* and **bold** font styles. ex: ```*italicized*``` and ```**bold**```
* Use title 1 for segment headings. ex: ```# Segment Title```
* Use title 2 for segment section. ex: ```## Step 1```
* Use title 3 for sub-sections. ex: ```### Step 1: part 1```
